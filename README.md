# Contract-Net-Protocol
An implementation of Contract-Net Protocol in an attacker/defender scenario


This project is an implementation of a Contract-Net Protocol agents in an attacker/defender scenario. The CNP algorithm let the defender agents reach the aim of putting away the attacker team from the goal state. The agents should also take into account the constraints of the environment.

This program is written in C++ language with OpenCV library as the visualization library.



> **Requirements:**

> - OpenCV 2.4 or higher</br>


### How to Run 

Compile the source using the 'make' command, then execute the CNP file. you can also change the behaviour in the CNP.cpp file
